Project files for MS Visual Studio 2010 :

By default the project expect SDL 1.2 SDL Image 1.2 and Lua 5.3 to be installed
in directories :
  ..\..\..\..\SDL-1.2.15
  ..\..\..\..\SDL_image-1.2.12
  ..\..\..\..\lua

That is, if grafX2 sources are in C:\stuff\code\grafX2
Visual studio project files are in C:\stuff\code\grafX2\project\msvc
and it is expected you have C:\stuff\lua etc.
